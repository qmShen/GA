\section{GAIA GRAMMAR FORMALIZATION}
\label{sec:gaia_grammar_formalization}

Gaia is a high-level declarative language that enables efficient expression and reusability for animated infographics.
To achieve reusing spec, Gaia decouples target types from d
Gaia spec consists of two parts: animation/template spec, and target spec.


In the rest of this section, we first introduce the basic grammar to create an animation in Gaia, then discuss how to reuse them as templates on structured targets defined by target type spec.

\subsection{Animation Spec}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white!5!white,colframe=yellow!75!black,title=Example - Part 1]
  My box with my title.
