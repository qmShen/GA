%% Abstract section.
\abstract{%
  Animated infographics are a potent storytelling tool in various fields, from business to science communication. However, their creation is often laborious, involving meticulous element selection, property adjustments, and timing management.
  % Gaia
  Therefore, we propose \gaia{}, a declarative grammar designed to streamline animated infographic creation.
  With \gaia{}, users can craft animations expressively and intuitively, abstracting away the underlying implementation.
  Via an abstraction of animated targets, \gaia{} provides an approach to express, save and share infographic animations from expert designers and allows novices to reuse them, significantly speeding up the creation process.
  % Evaluation
  We implemented a componentized \gaia{} compiler prototype and built a demo system based on it with diverse examples to showcase its usability.
  In a user study involving non-expert participants, individuals with no prior animation experience successfully replicated real-world animations within just one hour of learning.
  \gaia{} has been applied in several practical projects, further advancing the field of animated infographic authoring.
